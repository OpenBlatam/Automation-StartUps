Where:
- EMV = Earned Media Value (traditional calculation)
- Brand Value = Brand awareness and recognition improvements
- Lead Value = Qualified leads generated and converted
- Partnership Value = Strategic partnerships and collaborations
- Total Investment = All costs including team, tools, content, and time
```

**Performance Benchmarking System:**
```
Industry Benchmark Comparison:

- Top 25% Performers: 450%+ ROI, 89%+ success rate
- Top 50% Performers: 350%+ ROI, 78%+ success rate
- Average Performers: 250%+ ROI, 67%+ success rate
- Below Average: <250% ROI, <67% success rate
```

### 2. Advanced ROI Calculation Framework
**Earned Media Value (EMV) Formula:**
```
EMV = (Media Mentions × Average Reach × Engagement Rate × Conversion Rate × Average Deal Value)
- Media Mentions: Number of media mentions generated
- Average Reach: Average audience size of media outlets
- Engagement Rate: % of audience that engages with content
- Conversion Rate: % of engaged audience that converts to leads
- Average Deal Value: Average value of closed deals from media leads
```

**Example Calculation:**
```
EMV = (25 mentions × 50,000 reach × 0.12 engagement × 0.05 conversion × $25,000 deal value)
EMV = $1,875,000
```

**Cost-Benefit Analysis:**
