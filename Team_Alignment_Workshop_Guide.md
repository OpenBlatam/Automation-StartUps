- Create safe environment for honest feedback
- Recognize and celebrate contributions

### Time Management
**Problem:** Workshop running over time or not covering all topics
**Solutions:**
- Stick to strict time limits for each exercise
- Prioritize most important alignment topics
- Schedule follow-up sessions for remaining items
- Use breakout groups to cover more ground

This workshop guide ensures that your team is fully aligned around a compelling investor message, with clear ownership of key points and confidence in the supporting evidence.
