# Sales Copy: AI Course - TONO CONSULTIVO/EDUCATIVO

## Target Audience: Business Owners, Entrepreneurs, Marketing Professionals

### Opening Hook (Educational & Curious)
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from [Company]. I'm calling because I've been studying how AI is transforming businesses across different industries, and I'd love to get your perspective on something. Do you have a few minutes to share your thoughts on how AI might impact your industry?"

### Problem Identification (Consultative & Insightful)
"I've been researching the challenges that business owners face when it comes to AI adoption, and I'm curious about your experience. From what I've observed, there are typically three main barriers:

1. **Knowledge Gap**: Many business owners know AI is important but aren't sure where to start
2. **Implementation Challenges**: Even when they want to use AI, they struggle with the technical aspects
3. **ROI Uncertainty**: They're not sure if the investment will actually pay off

Which of these resonates most with your current situation, or are you facing different challenges entirely?"

### Solution Presentation (Educational & Comprehensive)
"Based on my research and work with hundreds of business owners, I've developed a comprehensive approach to AI implementation that addresses these common challenges.

**Our AI Mastery Program is structured around three core pillars:**

**1. Foundation Building (Weeks 1-2)**
- Understanding AI capabilities and limitations
- Identifying automation opportunities in your specific business
- Setting up your first AI tools and workflows
- Creating your AI implementation roadmap

**2. Strategic Implementation (Weeks 3-4)**
- Advanced automation techniques for your industry
- AI-powered marketing and sales strategies
- Customer service and support automation
- Data analysis and decision-making with AI

**3. Optimization and Scaling (Weeks 5-6)**
- Advanced AI strategies for growth
- Competitive advantage through AI
- Long-term AI strategy development
- Building your AI-powered business model

**What makes this different is that it's not just theory - it's a hands-on, practical approach that you can implement immediately.**"

### Social Proof (Educational & Analytical)
"I've been tracking the results of our program participants, and the data is quite compelling:

**Quantitative Results:**
- Average time savings: 22 hours per week
- Average revenue increase: 35% within 90 days
- Average cost reduction: 28% in operational expenses
- Average customer satisfaction improvement: 42%

**Qualitative Feedback:**
- 94% of participants report feeling more confident about AI
- 87% say they can now identify new AI opportunities
- 91% report improved work-life balance
- 89% feel more competitive in their market

**Case Study Example:**
One participant, a marketing consultant, was able to automate 80% of his client reporting, which allowed him to take on 40% more clients without increasing his workload. His revenue increased by $180,000 in the first year."

### Educational Value Proposition
"What I find most valuable about this program is that it's not just about learning AI tools - it's about developing an AI mindset. You'll learn to:

- **Think systematically** about automation opportunities
- **Evaluate AI solutions** based on your specific needs
- **Implement changes gradually** to minimize risk
- **Measure and optimize** your AI investments
- **Stay current** with AI developments in your industry

**The goal is to make you self-sufficient in AI implementation, not dependent on external consultants.**"

### Objection Handling (Consultative & Understanding)

**"I'm not sure if AI is right for my business"**
"That's a very valid concern, and I appreciate you being honest about it. The truth is, AI isn't right for every business or every situation. That's why we start with a comprehensive assessment of your specific business model, processes, and goals. We'll help you identify where AI can add real value and where it might not be the right solution. The goal is to make an informed decision based on your unique circumstances."

**"I'm worried about the learning curve"**
"I completely understand that concern. Learning new technology can feel overwhelming, especially when you're already busy running a business. That's why we've designed the program to be progressive - we start with the basics and build up gradually. Plus, you'll have access to our community of other business owners who are going through the same process. You're not learning alone."

**"What if I invest in this and it doesn't work?"**
"That's a very reasonable concern, and I respect that you're thinking about ROI. Here's what I can tell you: we offer a 30-day money-back guarantee, and we track your progress throughout the program. If you're not seeing measurable results within the first month, we'll work with you to identify what's not working and either fix it or refund your investment. Your success is our success."

**"I need to discuss this with my team"**
"Absolutely, that's exactly what I'd recommend. This kind of decision should involve your team, especially if they'll be using the AI tools. In fact, we offer team training sessions and can work with your entire organization to ensure everyone is aligned and comfortable with the changes. When would be a good time to schedule a call with your team?"

### Investment Discussion (Educational & Transparent)
"The investment for the complete program is $2,997, which includes:

- 6 weeks of comprehensive training
- Access to our AI tools library
- Monthly group coaching calls
- Private community access
- Lifetime updates and new content
- 30-day money-back guarantee

**To put this in perspective:** If this program saves you just 10 hours per week, and you value your time at $50 per hour, you're looking at $500 in weekly value, or $26,000 annually. Most participants see a positive ROI within the first 60 days."

### Close (Consultative & Respectful)
"I'd like to propose a next step that I think would be valuable for both of us. I can send you a free assessment tool that will help you identify the specific AI opportunities in your business. This will give you a clear picture of what's possible and help you make an informed decision about whether this program is right for you.

I can also schedule a brief call to discuss your specific situation and answer any questions you might have. There's no pressure to enroll - I just want to make sure you have all the information you need to make the best decision for your business.

Would you be interested in receiving the assessment tool and scheduling a brief consultation call?"

### Follow-up (Educational & Helpful)
"I'll send you the assessment tool along with some additional resources that I think you'll find valuable, including:

- A guide to AI opportunities in your industry
- Case studies from similar businesses
- A checklist for evaluating AI solutions
- Links to our free webinars and resources

I'll also include my calendar link so you can schedule a consultation call at your convenience. Remember, there's no obligation - I just want to help you make an informed decision about AI for your business.

What's the best email address to send this information to?"
