# Email 1: "We Screwed Up" - Win-Back Sequence

**Subject Line:** We lost you, and that's on us

**Send Day:** Day 1

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

I need to be honest with you.

We screwed up.

You signed up for our AI course and marketing insights because you wanted to stay ahead of the curve. But somewhere along the way, we stopped delivering the value you deserved.

Maybe our emails became too salesy. Maybe we stopped sharing the breakthrough AI strategies that actually move the needle. Maybe we got caught up in our own success and forgot why you joined us in the first place.

The truth is, we've been working on something revolutionary - an AI bulk document generator that creates comprehensive business documents from a single query. But we've been terrible at showing you how this could transform your workflow.

**Here's what I need from you:** 

Tell me what went wrong. What would make our AI insights valuable again? What's the one thing you wish we'd focus on?

Just hit reply and let me know. Your feedback will shape everything we do moving forward.

Because you deserve better than what we've been giving you.

Best,
[YOUR_NAME]

P.S. We're about to launch something that will change how you think about AI in business. But first, I want to make sure we're building it for YOU.
