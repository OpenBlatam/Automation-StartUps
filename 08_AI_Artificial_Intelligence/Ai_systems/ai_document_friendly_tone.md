# Sales Copy: AI Bulk Document Creation Tool - TONO AMIGABLE/CONSULTIVO

## Target Audience: Small Business Owners, Solo Practitioners, Freelancers

### Opening Hook (Warm & Personal)
"Hi [Name]! This is [Your Name] from [Company]. I hope you're having a great day! I'm calling because I just helped someone in your exact situation save 15 hours per week on document creation, and I thought you might be interested in hearing how. Do you have a couple of minutes to chat?"

### Problem Identification (Empathetic & Understanding)
"You know, I talk to so many business owners who tell me the same thing - they love what they do, but they're spending way too much time on paperwork and document creation instead of focusing on their actual business.

I'm curious - how much time would you say you spend each week creating contracts, proposals, reports, or other documents? And I bet you've had those moments where you're working late into the night trying to get everything done, right?"

### Solution Presentation (Conversational & Helpful)
"Well, I have some really good news for you! We've created something that's going to make your life so much easier. It's like having a super-smart assistant who knows exactly what documents you need and can create them in seconds.

**Here's how it works:**
- You just tell our AI what kind of document you need
- It creates not just that document, but all the related ones too
- Everything is perfectly formatted and includes all the legal stuff you need
- You can customize anything to match your brand and style

**For example:** If you need an employment contract, our AI will create the contract, the offer letter, the confidentiality agreement, and even the onboarding checklist - all in about 30 seconds!"

### Social Proof (Relatable & Personal)
"Oh, you're going to love hearing this! Just last week, I spoke with Sarah, who runs a small consulting firm. She was spending 20 hours per week just on proposals and contracts. Now? She creates everything in about 2 hours and spends the rest of her time actually working with clients.

And Mike, who's a real estate agent, told me he used to stay up until midnight creating property reports. Now he can create 10 reports in the time it used to take to do one, and they're actually better quality!

The best part? They both said they wish they had found this sooner because it would have saved them so much stress and time."

### Demo Offer (Friendly & Low-Pressure)
"You know what? I'd love to show you exactly how this works. I can do a quick 5-minute demo using the type of documents you actually create. It's really fun to watch - you'll be amazed at how fast and accurate it is!

Would you be interested in seeing a quick demonstration? I promise it won't take long, and you'll see immediately how this could help you."

### Objection Handling (Understanding & Supportive)

**"I'm not very tech-savvy"**
"Oh, don't worry about that at all! That's actually one of the things people love most about our platform. You don't need to be tech-savvy at all. It's designed to be super simple - you just type what you want, and it does the rest. Plus, we have amazing customer support that will help you with anything you need."

**"What if I make a mistake in the documents?"**
"That's such a great question! Our AI is really smart about catching mistakes and making sure everything is correct. It knows all the legal requirements and best practices. But you know what? You can always review and edit anything before you use it. It's like having a really good proofreader built right in!"

**"How much does this cost?"**
"I'm so glad you asked! Our basic plan is just $97 per month, which is less than what most people spend on coffee. But here's the thing - if this saves you just 5 hours per week, and you value your time at even $20 per hour, you're saving $400 per month. So it actually pays for itself and then some!"

**"I need to think about it"**
"Of course! I totally understand wanting to think things through. That's actually really smart. You know what I can do? I can send you a free trial so you can try it out for yourself with no pressure at all. That way you can see exactly how it works and decide if it's right for you."

### Urgency (Gentle & Helpful)
"You know, I should mention that we're currently offering a special bonus for new users - we're including 3 months of our premium templates for free, which normally costs $297. But this offer is only available for the next few days because we want to make sure we can give everyone the personal attention they deserve."

### Close (Warm & Encouraging)
"I really think this could make such a difference for you and your business. I'd love to get you set up with our free trial so you can see for yourself how much time and stress this could save you.

The best part is there's no risk at all - you can try it for 14 days completely free, and if you don't love it, you can cancel anytime with no questions asked.

Would you like me to get you set up with the free trial right now? It only takes about 2 minutes to get started."

### Follow-up (Caring & Supportive)
"You know what? I'm going to send you something really helpful. I'll send you a free guide that shows you 10 ways to save time on document creation, plus a link to start your free trial whenever you're ready.

I really believe this could make your work life so much easier and less stressful. And remember, there's no pressure at all - just take a look when you have time and see what you think.

What's the best email address to send this to you?"
