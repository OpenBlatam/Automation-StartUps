# Sales Copy: AI Course - CONTRASTE Y ANCLAJE

## Target Audience: Business Owners and Marketing Professionals

### Opening Hook (Contrast + Anchoring: Comparison + Reference Point + Value)
"[Name], this is [Your Name] from [Company]. I'm calling because I just discovered something that's going to change everything - there's a secret that 97% of business owners don't know, and it's making the 3% who do know it absolutely unstoppable. But here's what's really interesting: while most people are spending $50,000 on expensive consultants who don't deliver results, the smart ones are using this $2,997 system that actually works. In fact, let me show you the difference between what you're probably doing now versus what the successful 3% are doing. Do you have 3 minutes to discover why this $2,997 system is better than $50,000 consultants?"

### Problem Identification (Contrast + Anchoring: Comparison + Reference Point + Value)
"Before I show you why this $2,997 system is better than $50,000 consultants, let me ask you something that's going to make you realize the contrast: How much are you currently spending on business advice that doesn't work? How many expensive consultants have you hired who promised results but delivered nothing? How many $10,000 courses have you bought that left you exactly where you started?

**Here's what I discovered after analyzing 10,000 business investments:**

**The $50,000 vs. $2,997 Investment Divide:**
- **97% of business owners** are spending $50,000+ on expensive consultants who don't deliver
- **3% of business owners** are spending $2,997 on a system that actually works

**The result?** The 97% are wasting money, while the 3% are making money.

**But here's what's really interesting:** The 3% aren't necessarily smarter, harder working, or more talented. They just know something that the 97% don't.

**They know the secret to business success that actually works.**

**And here's what's really valuable:** 2,847 business owners have already discovered this secret, and they're making money while everyone else is wasting money.

**The question is: How much longer are you going to waste money on expensive consultants who don't deliver?**

**And here's what 2,847 business owners are saying:** 'We wish we had known this sooner. We wish we had stopped wasting money on expensive consultants earlier. We wish we had found this $2,997 system sooner.'"

### Social Proof (Contrast + Anchoring: Comparison + Reference Point + Value)
"Let me share something that will make you realize the contrast. Last month, I received this message from Sarah, who owns a consulting firm:

*'[Your Name], I can't believe what's happened. In just 90 days, I went from wasting $50,000 on consultants to making $340,000 in additional revenue with your $2,997 system. I'm so glad I stopped wasting money on expensive consultants - I would have never known about this otherwise!'*

**But here's the most incredible part:** Sarah was about to hire another $50,000 consultant when she found our system. She was wasting money, getting no results, and ready to give up. Today, she's not just surviving - she's thriving.

**And she's not alone.** Here's what our 2,847 students are saying:

**The Value Comparison Millionaire Club (Students who stopped wasting money and generated $1M+ in additional revenue):**
- **Mike from TechStart**: 'I went from wasting $50,000 on consultants to making $2.3M in additional revenue with your $2,997 system. This isn't just a course - it's a value comparison machine.'
- **Jennifer from RetailMax**: 'I stopped wasting money on expensive consultants and now I work 20 hours per week while making 5x more money. Your $2,997 system is better than any $50,000 consultant.'
- **David from ServicePro**: 'I went from wasting money on consultants to making money with your system, and I went from 1 location to 12 locations in 2 years. This system doesn't just work - it's better than expensive consultants.'

**The Value Comparison Time Freedom Club (Students who stopped wasting money and reduced their workweek by 50%+):**
- **Lisa from ConsultingPro**: 'I went from wasting $50,000 on consultants to making money with your $2,997 system, and I went from 80 hours per week to 25 hours per week, and my revenue increased by 300%. I'm finally free because I stopped wasting money.'
- **Robert from AgencyMax**: 'I stopped wasting money on expensive consultants and now I'm free to focus on what I love. Your $2,997 system gave me my life back.'
- **Amanda from BusinessBuilders**: 'I went from wasting money on consultants to making money with your system, and I went from working IN my business to working ON my business. Now I'm the architect of my own success.'

**The Value Comparison Dominance Club (Students who stopped wasting money and became market leaders):**
- **James from TechSolutions**: 'I went from wasting $50,000 on consultants to making money with your $2,997 system, and I went from #3 in my market to #1 in 6 months. Your system is better than any expensive consultant.'
- **Maria from ServiceMaster**: 'I stopped wasting money on expensive consultants and now I'm closing deals while I sleep. This is the future of value comparison.'
- **Michael from GrowthPro**: 'I went from wasting money on consultants to making money with your system, and I went from 5% market share to 35% market share in 2 years. This system doesn't just work - it's better than expensive consultants.'

**But here's what's really incredible:** These aren't just success stories - these are value comparison stories. These are people who went from wasting money to making money.

**And here's what 2,847 business owners are saying:** 'We wish we had known this sooner. We wish we had stopped wasting money on expensive consultants earlier. We wish we had found this $2,997 system sooner.'"

### Authority Building (Contrast + Anchoring: Comparison + Reference Point + Value)
"Now, you might be wondering: 'Who is this person, and why should I trust them?'

Let me share something personal with you. Three years ago, I was exactly where you are now. I was wasting money on expensive consultants, working 80 hours per week, barely keeping my head above water, and watching my competitors succeed while I struggled.

**But then I had a value comparison realization.** What if I could discover the secret to business success without wasting $50,000 on consultants? What if I could find a $2,997 system that actually works?

**So I did something crazy.** I spent $2.3 million of my own money testing every AI tool, strategy, and technique available. I failed more times than I can count. But through those failures, I discovered something incredible.

**I discovered the secret that helps you stop wasting money and start making money.**

**Today, I'm not just teaching this - I'm living it.** My business runs itself 24/7, generating revenue while I sleep, while I'm on vacation, while I'm spending time with my family.

**And here's what's really interesting:** 2,847 business owners have chosen to work with me. They've chosen to trust me with their most important asset - their money. They've chosen to follow my value comparison system and transform their lives.

**And now, for the first time ever, I'm sharing this exact system with a select group of business owners who are serious about stopping wasting money.**

**But here's the catch:** I can only work with 50 people at this level of intensity. Any more than that, and the quality suffers.

**And here's what 2,847 business owners are saying:** 'Don't wait. Don't hesitate. Don't make the same mistake we made. Join us now and stop wasting money today.'"

### Objection Handling (Contrast + Anchoring: Comparison + Reference Point + Value)

**"I need to think about it"**
"I completely understand. In fact, I respect that you want to think it through. But let me ask you something: What exactly are you thinking about? Are you thinking about whether this will work? Because I can show you 2,847 people who prove it does. Are you thinking about the investment? Because I can show you the exact ROI calculations.

**Or are you thinking about whether you want to stop wasting money on expensive consultants?** Because that's the real question, isn't it? How much longer are you going to waste money on consultants who don't deliver?

**But here's the thing:** While you're thinking, those 12 spots are filling up. And once they're gone, you'll have to wait 3 months for the next opportunity.

**And here's what 2,847 business owners are saying:** 'Don't wait. Don't hesitate. Don't make the same mistake we made. Join us now and stop wasting money today.'"

**"I don't have time for another course"**
"That's exactly why you need this course. You're too busy working IN your business to work ON your business. This course will give you back 31 hours per week. If you don't have time for this, you don't have time to succeed.

**Here's the truth:** You're not too busy for this course - you're too busy NOT having this course.

**But here's the thing:** While you're saying you don't have time, those 12 spots are filling up. And once they're gone, you'll have to wait 3 months for the next opportunity.

**And here's what 2,847 business owners are saying:** 'Don't wait. Don't hesitate. Don't make the same mistake we made. Join us now and stop wasting money today.'"

**"What's the cost?"**
"The investment is $2,997. But let me ask you this: What's the cost of NOT stopping wasting money on expensive consultants? What's the cost of continuing to waste $50,000 on consultants who don't deliver? What's the cost of not getting the results you want?

**The real question isn't whether you can afford this - it's whether you can afford NOT to stop wasting money.**

**But here's the thing:** While you're asking about price, those 12 spots are filling up. And once they're gone, you'll have to wait 3 months for the next opportunity.

**And here's what 2,847 business owners are saying:** 'Don't wait. Don't hesitate. Don't make the same mistake we made. Join us now and stop wasting money today.'"

**"I'm not tech-savvy"**
"Perfect! That's exactly why this course exists. You don't need to be tech-savvy - you need to be value-savvy. And that's what this course teaches you.

**Here's what I'll do:** I'll personally walk you through every single step. You'll have my direct phone number. You can call me anytime with questions. I'm not just teaching you - I'm mentoring you.

**The question isn't whether you're tech-savvy - it's whether you're ready to learn from someone who's already figured out how to stop wasting money.**

**But here's the thing:** While you're saying you're not tech-savvy, those 12 spots are filling up. And once they're gone, you'll have to wait 3 months for the next opportunity.

**And here's what 2,847 business owners are saying:** 'Don't wait. Don't hesitate. Don't make the same mistake we made. Join us now and stop wasting money today.'"

### Close (Contrast + Anchoring: Comparison + Reference Point + Value)
"I'm going to be completely honest with you. I don't need your money. I don't need more students. I'm doing this because I remember what it felt like to be where you are now.

**But here's what I do need:** I need to know that you're serious about stopping wasting money. I need to know that you're ready to stop wasting money on expensive consultants and start using a system that actually works. I need to know that you're ready to join the 2,847 business owners who have already stopped wasting money.

**So here's what I'm going to do:** I'm going to give you the opportunity to join this exclusive group. But I'm only going to do it if you're ready to commit to your own value comparison.

**The question is:** Are you ready to stop wasting money and start making money? Are you ready to join the 2,847 business owners who dominate their markets?

**If the answer is yes, then I want you to say yes right now. Because those 12 spots are filling up fast, and this value comparison won't wait.**

**And here's what 2,847 business owners are saying:** 'Don't wait. Don't hesitate. Don't make the same mistake we made. Join us now and stop wasting money today.'"

### Follow-up (If They Hesitate - Contrast + Anchoring: Comparison + Reference Point + Value)
"Look, I get it. Change is scary. But you know what's scarier? Continuing to waste money for the rest of your life.

**I'm going to do something I've never done before.** I'm going to send you a free 45-minute training that shows you exactly how to stop wasting money on expensive consultants and start using a system that actually works. This training usually costs $500, but I'm giving it to you free.

**But here's the catch:** You have 24 hours to watch it and decide. After that, the offer expires and you go back to wasting money.

**And here's the thing:** While you're deciding, those 12 spots are filling up. And once they're gone, you'll have to wait 3 months for the next opportunity.

**And here's what 2,847 business owners are saying:** 'Don't wait. Don't hesitate. Don't make the same mistake we made. Join us now and stop wasting money today.'"
