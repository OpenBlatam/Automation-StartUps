# Sales Copy: AI Course - PSICOLOGÍA INVERSA

## Target Audience: Business Owners and Marketing Professionals

### Opening Hook (Reverse Psychology)
"[Name], this is [Your Name] from [Company]. I'm calling because I need to be completely honest with you - this AI course probably isn't right for you. In fact, I'm going to try to talk you OUT of enrolling. Do you have 3 minutes to hear why you should probably just hang up and go back to working 80 hours per week?"

### Problem Identification (Reverse Psychology + Challenge)
"Look, let me be brutally honest. Most business owners I talk to think they want AI automation, but they're not actually ready for it. They think they want to work less and make more money, but they're not willing to do what it takes.

**Here's the truth:** AI automation isn't for everyone. It's only for people who are:
- Tired of being the bottleneck in their own success
- Willing to invest in their future instead of just surviving
- Ready to stop making excuses and start taking action
- Committed to transforming their business, not just tweaking it

**Now, let me ask you something:** Are you one of those people, or are you just another business owner who's going to keep doing the same thing and expecting different results?

**Because if you're not serious about change, then this course definitely isn't for you.**"

### Solution Presentation (Reverse Psychology + Challenge)
"Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to tell you exactly what this course involves, and then you can decide if you're actually ready for it.

**This course is NOT for you if:**
- You're happy working 80 hours per week
- You enjoy being the bottleneck in your own business
- You like watching your competitors succeed while you struggle
- You prefer making excuses instead of making money
- You're not willing to invest in your own success

**This course IS for you if:**
- You're tired of working harder instead of smarter
- You want to automate 80% of your business operations
- You're ready to generate $10K+ in additional monthly revenue
- You want to work 25 hours per week instead of 80
- You're committed to becoming the entrepreneur you always knew you could be

**Now, here's the question:** Which category do you fall into? Because if you're in the first category, I'm going to recommend you hang up right now and go back to what you were doing."

### Social Proof (Reverse Psychology + Challenge)
"Let me share something that might surprise you. I've had to turn away 347 business owners from this course because they weren't ready for it. They thought they wanted AI automation, but they weren't willing to do the work.

**But here's what's interesting:** The 2,500 business owners who were ready for it have generated over $47 million in additional revenue. They've transformed their businesses and their lives.

**Here's what they're saying:**
- **Sarah, Tech Startup Founder**: 'I almost didn't enroll because I thought it was too good to be true. Now I'm making 5x more money while working half the hours.'
- **Mike, E-commerce Entrepreneur**: 'I was skeptical at first, but I was tired of struggling. This course changed everything.'
- **Jennifer, Service Business Owner**: 'I almost talked myself out of it, but I'm so glad I didn't. This is the best investment I've ever made.'

**But here's the thing:** These people were ready for change. They were tired of the status quo. They were willing to invest in their future.

**The question is:** Are you one of those people, or are you going to keep doing what you've always done?"

### Authority Building (Reverse Psychology + Challenge)
"Now, you might be wondering: 'Who is this person, and why should I trust them?'

Let me tell you something that might surprise you. I'm not going to try to convince you that I'm an expert. I'm not going to list my credentials or brag about my success. Instead, I'm going to tell you the truth.

**The truth is:** I was exactly where you are now. I was working 80 hours per week, barely keeping my head above water, and watching my competitors succeed while I struggled. I was making every excuse in the book about why I couldn't succeed.

**But then I got tired of making excuses.** I got tired of working harder instead of smarter. I got tired of being the bottleneck in my own success.

**So I did something crazy.** I spent $2.3 million of my own money testing every AI tool, strategy, and technique available. I failed more times than I can count. But through those failures, I discovered the exact formula that separates the winners from the losers.

**Today, I'm not just teaching this - I'm living it.** My business runs itself 24/7, generating revenue while I sleep, while I'm on vacation, while I'm spending time with my family.

**But here's the thing:** I'm not going to try to convince you that this will work for you. I'm not going to make promises I can't keep. I'm just going to tell you the truth about what's possible.

**The question is:** Are you ready to hear the truth, or are you going to keep making excuses?"

### Scarcity + Urgency (Reverse Psychology + Challenge)
"Here's where things get interesting. I'm only accepting 50 new students this quarter. Not because I want to be exclusive, but because I provide something that most people don't: **personal access to me.**

Every student gets:
- **Direct access to me** for 30 days
- **Personal coaching calls** where I review their specific situation
- **Custom implementation plan** tailored to their business
- **Lifetime access** to our private community

**But here's the catch:** I can only work with 50 people at this level of intensity. Any more than that, and the quality suffers.

**We currently have 12 spots remaining.**
**Enrollment closes in 72 hours.**
**After that, you wait 3 months for the next opportunity.**

**But here's the thing:** I'm not going to try to convince you to enroll. I'm not going to pressure you or make you feel like you're missing out. I'm just going to tell you the facts.

**The facts are:** There are 12 spots left, and they're filling up fast. If you want one of those spots, you need to decide now. If you don't, that's fine too. There are plenty of other courses out there.

**The question is:** Are you ready to make a decision, or are you going to keep procrastinating?"

### Objection Handling (Reverse Psychology + Challenge)

**"I need to think about it"**
"Perfect! That's exactly what I want you to do. Think about it. Think about whether you're ready for change. Think about whether you're willing to invest in your future. Think about whether you're tired of making excuses.

**But here's the thing:** While you're thinking, those 12 spots are filling up. And once they're gone, you'll have to wait 3 months for the next opportunity.

**So think about this:** Are you going to keep thinking, or are you going to start taking action? Because thinking without action is just procrastination."

**"I don't have time for another course"**
"Exactly! That's exactly why you need this course. You're too busy working IN your business to work ON your business. This course will give you back 31 hours per week. If you don't have time for this, you don't have time to succeed.

**But here's the thing:** You're not too busy for this course - you're too busy NOT having this course.

**So here's the question:** Are you going to keep being too busy, or are you going to make time for what matters?"

**"What's the cost?"**
"The investment is $2,997. But let me ask you this: What's the cost of NOT doing this? What's the cost of watching your competitors dominate while you struggle? What's the cost of working 80 hours per week for the rest of your life?

**The real question isn't whether you can afford this - it's whether you can afford NOT to do this.**

**But here's the thing:** If you're asking about the cost, you're probably not ready for this course. People who are ready for transformation don't ask about the cost - they ask about the value."

**"I'm not tech-savvy"**
"Perfect! That's exactly why this course exists. You don't need to be tech-savvy - you need to be business-savvy. And that's what this course teaches you.

**But here's the thing:** If you're using "I'm not tech-savvy" as an excuse, then this course definitely isn't for you. People who are ready for change don't make excuses - they find solutions.

**So here's the question:** Are you going to keep making excuses, or are you going to start finding solutions?"

### Close (Reverse Psychology + Challenge)
"I'm going to be completely honest with you. I don't need your money. I don't need more students. I'm doing this because I remember what it felt like to be where you are now.

**But here's what I do need:** I need to know that you're serious about transformation. I need to know that you're ready to stop making excuses and start taking action. I need to know that you're ready to join the 2,500 business owners who have already transformed their lives.

**So here's what I'm going to do:** I'm going to give you the opportunity to join this exclusive group. But I'm only going to do it if you're ready to commit to your own success.

**The question is:** Are you ready to stop being the bottleneck in your own success and start being the architect of your own success? Are you ready to join the entrepreneurs who work less and make more?

**If the answer is yes, then I want you to say yes right now. If the answer is no, then I want you to hang up and go back to what you were doing.**

**But here's the thing:** I'm not going to try to convince you. I'm not going to pressure you. I'm just going to give you the opportunity to decide.

**What's your decision?**"

### Follow-up (If They Hesitate - Final Reverse Psychology Push)
"Look, I get it. Change is scary. But you know what's scarier? Staying exactly where you are for the rest of your life.

**I'm going to do something I've never done before.** I'm going to send you a free 45-minute training that shows you exactly how to automate your first $10K in revenue. This training usually costs $500, but I'm giving it to you free.

**But here's the catch:** You have 24 hours to watch it and decide. After that, the offer expires and you go back to competing with one hand tied behind your back.

**And here's the thing:** I'm not going to try to convince you to watch it. I'm not going to pressure you or make you feel like you're missing out. I'm just going to give you the opportunity.

**This is your moment. This is your opportunity. This is your chance to finally break free from the excuses that have been holding you back.**

**But here's the question:** Are you going to take this opportunity, or are you going to keep making excuses?

**What's your email address?**"
