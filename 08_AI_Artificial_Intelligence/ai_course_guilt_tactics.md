# Sales Copy: AI Course - TÁCTICAS DE CULPA

## Target Audience: Business Owners and Marketing Professionals

### Opening Hook (Guilt Tactics: Family + Responsibility + Failure)
"[Name], this is [Your Name] from [Company]. I'm calling because I just discovered something that's going to make you feel guilty - your family is counting on you to succeed, but you're failing them every day you don't have AI automation. Your children deserve better, your spouse deserves better, and you're letting them down by not taking action. Do you have 3 minutes to discover how to stop failing your family and start giving them the life they deserve?"

### Problem Identification (Guilt Tactics: Family + Responsibility + Failure)
"Before I show you how to stop failing your family, let me ask you something that's going to make you feel guilty: How many times have you had to tell your children 'no' because you couldn't afford something? How many times have you had to work late and miss important family moments? How many times have you had to tell your spouse that you can't take that vacation or buy that house because you're not making enough money?

**Here's what I discovered after analyzing 10,000 failed business attempts:**

**The Family Failure Reality:**
- **97% of business owners** are failing their families every day
- **3% of business owners** are providing for their families like they deserve

**The result?** The 97% are letting their families down, while the 3% are giving their families the life they deserve.

**But here's what's really heartbreaking:** The 97% aren't necessarily bad people. They just don't know how to stop failing their families.

**They don't know the secret to providing for their families like they deserve.**

**And here's what's really sad:** 2,847 business owners have already discovered this secret, and they're providing for their families while everyone else is letting them down.

**The question is: How much longer are you going to let your family down?**

**And here's what 2,847 business owners are saying:** 'We wish we had known this sooner. We wish we had stopped failing our families earlier. We wish we had started providing for them sooner.'"

### Social Proof (Guilt Tactics: Family + Success + Responsibility)
"Let me share something that will make you feel both guilty and hopeful. Last month, I received this message from Sarah, who owns a consulting firm:

*'[Your Name], I can't believe what's happened. In just 90 days, I went from failing my family to providing for them like they deserve. My revenue increased by 340%, and I can finally say 'yes' to everything my children need. My family is proud of me, and I'm finally the parent I always wanted to be!'*

**But here's the most incredible part:** Sarah was about to give up when she found our program. She was failing her family, struggling to provide, and ready to quit. Today, she's not just surviving - she's thriving.

**And she's not alone.** Here's what our 2,847 students are saying:

**The Family Success Millionaire Club (Students who stopped failing their families and generated $1M+ in additional revenue):**
- **Mike from TechStart**: 'I went from failing my family to providing for them like they deserve, and my revenue went from $50K to $2.3M in 18 months. This isn't just a course - it's a family success machine.'
- **Jennifer from RetailMax**: 'I stopped failing my family and now I work 20 hours per week while making 5x more money. My children are proud of me.'
- **David from ServicePro**: 'I went from failing my family to providing for them like they deserve, and I went from 1 location to 12 locations in 2 years. This system doesn't just work - it transforms families.'

**The Family Success Time Freedom Club (Students who stopped failing their families and reduced their workweek by 50%+):**
- **Lisa from ConsultingPro**: 'I went from failing my family to providing for them like they deserve, and I went from 80 hours per week to 25 hours per week, and my revenue increased by 300%. I'm finally the parent I always wanted to be.'
- **Robert from AgencyMax**: 'I stopped failing my family and now I'm free to focus on what I love. This system gave me my family back.'
- **Amanda from BusinessBuilders**: 'I went from failing my family to providing for them like they deserve, and I went from working IN my business to working ON my business. Now I'm the architect of my family's success.'

**The Family Success Dominance Club (Students who stopped failing their families and became market leaders):**
- **James from TechSolutions**: 'I went from failing my family to providing for them like they deserve, and I went from #3 in my market to #1 in 6 months. My family is proud of me.'
- **Maria from ServiceMaster**: 'I stopped failing my family and now I'm closing deals while I sleep. This is the future of family success.'
- **Michael from GrowthPro**: 'I went from failing my family to providing for them like they deserve, and I went from 5% market share to 35% market share in 2 years. This system doesn't just work - it transforms families.'

**But here's what's really incredible:** These aren't just success stories - these are family success stories. These are people who went from failing their families to providing for them like they deserve.

**And here's what 2,847 business owners are saying:** 'We wish we had known this sooner. We wish we had stopped failing our families earlier. We wish we had started providing for them sooner.'"

### Authority Building (Guilt Tactics: Family + Responsibility + Trust)
"Now, you might be wondering: 'Who is this person, and why should I trust them?'

Let me share something personal with you. Three years ago, I was exactly where you are now. I was failing my family, working 80 hours per week, barely keeping my head above water, and watching my competitors succeed while I struggled.

**But then I had a family realization.** What if I could discover the secret to providing for my family like they deserve? What if I could stop failing them and start succeeding for them?

**So I did something crazy.** I spent $2.3 million of my own money testing every AI tool, strategy, and technique available. I failed more times than I can count. But through those failures, I discovered something incredible.

**I discovered the secret that helps you provide for your family like they deserve.**

**Today, I'm not just teaching this - I'm living it.** My business runs itself 24/7, generating revenue while I sleep, while I'm on vacation, while I'm spending time with my family.

**And here's what's really interesting:** 2,847 business owners have chosen to work with me. They've chosen to trust me with their most important asset - their family's future. They've chosen to follow my family success system and transform their lives.

**And now, for the first time ever, I'm sharing this exact system with a select group of business owners who are serious about providing for their families.**

**But here's the catch:** I can only work with 50 people at this level of intensity. Any more than that, and the quality suffers.

**And here's what 2,847 business owners are saying:** 'Don't wait. Don't hesitate. Don't make the same mistake we made. Join us now and start providing for your family today.'"

### Objection Handling (Guilt Tactics: Family + Responsibility + Failure)

**"I need to think about it"**
"I completely understand. In fact, I respect that you want to think it through. But let me ask you something: What exactly are you thinking about? Are you thinking about whether this will work? Because I can show you 2,847 people who prove it does. Are you thinking about the investment? Because I can show you the exact ROI calculations.

**Or are you thinking about whether you can afford to keep failing your family?** Because that's the real question, isn't it? How much longer are you going to let your family down?

**But here's the thing:** While you're thinking, those 12 spots are filling up. And once they're gone, you'll have to wait 3 months for the next opportunity.

**And here's what 2,847 business owners are saying:** 'Don't wait. Don't hesitate. Don't make the same mistake we made. Join us now and start providing for your family today.'"

**"I don't have time for another course"**
"That's exactly why you need this course. You're too busy working IN your business to work ON your business. This course will give you back 31 hours per week. If you don't have time for this, you don't have time to succeed.

**Here's the truth:** You're not too busy for this course - you're too busy NOT having this course.

**But here's the thing:** While you're saying you don't have time, those 12 spots are filling up. And once they're gone, you'll have to wait 3 months for the next opportunity.

**And here's what 2,847 business owners are saying:** 'Don't wait. Don't hesitate. Don't make the same mistake we made. Join us now and start providing for your family today.'"

**"What's the cost?"**
"The investment is $2,997. But let me ask you this: What's the cost of NOT providing for your family? What's the cost of continuing to fail them? What's the cost of not being able to give them the life they deserve?

**The real question isn't whether you can afford this - it's whether you can afford NOT to provide for your family.**

**But here's the thing:** While you're asking about price, those 12 spots are filling up. And once they're gone, you'll have to wait 3 months for the next opportunity.

**And here's what 2,847 business owners are saying:** 'Don't wait. Don't hesitate. Don't make the same mistake we made. Join us now and start providing for your family today.'"

**"I'm not tech-savvy"**
"Perfect! That's exactly why this course exists. You don't need to be tech-savvy - you need to be family-savvy. And that's what this course teaches you.

**Here's what I'll do:** I'll personally walk you through every single step. You'll have my direct phone number. You can call me anytime with questions. I'm not just teaching you - I'm mentoring you.

**The question isn't whether you're tech-savvy - it's whether you're ready to learn from someone who's already figured out how to provide for their family.**

**But here's the thing:** While you're saying you're not tech-savvy, those 12 spots are filling up. And once they're gone, you'll have to wait 3 months for the next opportunity.

**And here's what 2,847 business owners are saying:** 'Don't wait. Don't hesitate. Don't make the same mistake we made. Join us now and start providing for your family today.'"

### Close (Guilt Tactics: Family + Responsibility + Success)
"I'm going to be completely honest with you. I don't need your money. I don't need more students. I'm doing this because I remember what it felt like to be where you are now.

**But here's what I do need:** I need to know that you're serious about providing for your family. I need to know that you're ready to stop failing them and start succeeding for them. I need to know that you're ready to join the 2,847 business owners who have already transformed their family's lives.

**So here's what I'm going to do:** I'm going to give you the opportunity to join this exclusive group. But I'm only going to do it if you're ready to commit to your family's success.

**The question is:** Are you ready to stop failing your family and start providing for them like they deserve? Are you ready to join the 2,847 business owners who give their families the life they deserve?

**If the answer is yes, then I want you to say yes right now. Because those 12 spots are filling up fast, and your family is counting on you.**

**And here's what 2,847 business owners are saying:** 'Don't wait. Don't hesitate. Don't make the same mistake we made. Join us now and start providing for your family today.'"

### Follow-up (If They Hesitate - Guilt Tactics: Family + Responsibility + Failure)
"Look, I get it. Change is scary. But you know what's scarier? Continuing to fail your family for the rest of your life.

**I'm going to do something I've never done before.** I'm going to send you a free 45-minute training that shows you exactly how to automate your first $10K in revenue and start providing for your family. This training usually costs $500, but I'm giving it to you free.

**But here's the catch:** You have 24 hours to watch it and decide. After that, the offer expires and you go back to failing your family.

**And here's the thing:** While you're deciding, those 12 spots are filling up. And once they're gone, you'll have to wait 3 months for the next opportunity.

**And here's what 2,847 business owners are saying:** 'Don't wait. Don't hesitate. Don't make the same mistake we made. Join us now and start providing for your family today.'"
