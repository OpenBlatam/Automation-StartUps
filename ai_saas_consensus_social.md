# Sales Copy: AI SaaS Marketing Tool - CONSENSO Y PRUEBA SOCIAL

## Target Audience: Marketing Directors, CMOs, and Digital Marketing Agencies

### Opening Hook (Consensus + Social Proof: Popularity + Validation + Acceptance)
"[Name], this is [Your Name] from [Company]. I'm calling because I just discovered something that's going to change everything - there's a secret that 97% of marketing professionals don't know, and it's making the 3% who do know it absolutely unstoppable. In fact, 847 Fortune 500 companies have already discovered this secret, and they're all using it to dominate their markets. When I tell you who's using it, you're going to want to know why everyone else is using it too. Do you have 3 minutes to discover why 847 Fortune 500 companies trust this secret and why you should too?"

### Problem Identification (Consensus + Social Proof: Popularity + Validation + Acceptance)
"Before I show you why 847 Fortune 500 companies trust this secret, let me ask you something that's going to make you realize how popular this is: How many times have you wondered what your competitors are doing? How many times have you wished you knew what the successful companies are using? How many times have you wanted to follow the crowd that's actually winning?

**Here's what I discovered after analyzing 50,000 marketing campaigns:**

**The 97% vs. 3% Popularity Divide:**
- **97% of marketing professionals** are using strategies that nobody else is using
- **3% of marketing professionals** are using strategies that everyone else is using

**The result?** The 97% are struggling, while the 3% are dominating.

**But here's what's really popular:** The 3% aren't necessarily smarter, harder working, or more talented. They just know something that the 97% don't.

**They know the secret that everyone else is using.**

**And here's what's really validating:** 847 Fortune 500 companies have already discovered this secret, and they're all using it to dominate their markets.

**The question is: How much longer are you going to use strategies that nobody else is using?**

**And here's what 847 Fortune 500 companies are saying:** 'We wish we had known this sooner. We wish we had started using this strategy earlier. We wish we had followed the crowd sooner.'"

### Solution Presentation (Consensus + Social Proof: Popularity + Validation + Acceptance)
"I'm [Your Name], and over the past 15 years, I've helped 847 Fortune 500 companies discover this secret and dominate their markets using a methodology that most people think is impossible. But here's the thing - it's not impossible. It's just misunderstood.

**What I'm about to share with you is the exact system that everyone else is using:**

**Popular Success Strategy #1: Use What Everyone Else Is Using**

**This isn't just another platform. This is the blueprint that's been used by 847 Fortune 500 companies to dominate their markets.**

**But here's where things get popular:** I'm only accepting 25 new clients this quarter. Not because I want to be exclusive, but because I provide something that most people don't: **personal access to me.**

Every client gets:
- **Direct access to me** for 30 days
- **Personal strategy sessions** where I review their specific situation
- **Custom implementation plan** tailored to their business
- **Lifetime access** to our private community of 847 Fortune 500 companies

**We currently have 7 spots remaining.**

**After that, you wait 3 months for the next opportunity.**

**And here's what 847 Fortune 500 companies are saying:** 'Don't wait. Don't hesitate. Don't make the same mistake we made. Join us now and start using what everyone else is using today.'"

### Social Proof (Consensus + Social Proof: Popularity + Validation + Acceptance)
"Let me share something that will make you realize how popular this is. Last month, I received this message from Sarah, who is the CMO at a Fortune 500 company:

*'[Your Name], I can't believe what's happened. In just 90 days, I went from struggling to dominating, and my campaign ROI increased by 340%. I'm so glad I started using what everyone else is using - I would have never known about this otherwise!'*

**But here's the most incredible part:** Sarah was about to lose her job when she found our platform. She was struggling, using strategies that nobody else was using, and ready to give up. Today, she's not just surviving - she's thriving.

**And she's not alone.** Here's what our 847 Fortune 500 clients are saying:

**The Popular Success Millionaire Club (Clients who started using what everyone else is using and generated $100M+ in additional revenue):**
- **TechCorp Global**: 'We went from struggling to dominating, and our revenue went from $50M to $200M in 18 months. This isn't just a platform - it's a popular success machine.'
- **RetailMax International**: 'We started using what everyone else is using and now generate 5x more leads while spending 60% less. Our competitors are asking us how we're doing this.'
- **Enterprise Solutions Inc**: 'We went from struggling to dominating, and we went from 15% market share to 45% market share in 2 years. This system doesn't just work - it makes you popular.'

**The Popular Success Efficiency Masters (Clients who started using what everyone else is using and reduced costs by 50%+):**
- **Fortune 500 Manufacturing**: 'We went from struggling to dominating, and we went from $2M monthly ad spend to $800K monthly ad spend, and our revenue increased by 180%. We're finally using what everyone else is using.'
- **Global Services Group**: 'We started using what everyone else is using and now we're free to focus on what we do best. This system made us popular.'
- **International Retail Chain**: 'We went from struggling to dominating, and we went from working IN our marketing to working ON our marketing. Now we're the architects of our own popularity.'

**The Popular Success Market Leaders (Clients who started using what everyone else is using and became industry leaders):**
- **Software Industry Leader**: 'We went from struggling to dominating, and we went from #3 in our market to #1 in 6 months. Our competitors are calling us asking how we're doing this.'
- **E-commerce Giant**: 'We started using what everyone else is using and now we're closing deals while we sleep. This is the future of popular success.'
- **B2B Services Leader**: 'We went from struggling to dominating, and we went from 5% market share to 35% market share in 2 years. This system doesn't just work - it makes you legendary.'

**But here's what's really incredible:** These aren't just success stories - these are popular success stories. These are companies that went from struggling to dominating.

**And here's what 847 Fortune 500 companies are saying:** 'We wish we had known this sooner. We wish we had started using this strategy earlier. We wish we had followed the crowd sooner.'"

### Authority Building (Consensus + Social Proof: Popularity + Validation + Acceptance)
"Now, you might be wondering: 'Who is this person, and why should I trust them?'

Let me share something personal with you. I'm [Your Name], and I've spent the last 15 years helping companies discover this secret and dominate their markets. I've worked with 847 Fortune 500 companies, analyzed over 50,000 marketing campaigns, and generated over $2.3 billion in additional revenue for my clients.

**But here's what really sets me apart:** I'm not just a consultant - I'm a practitioner. I've built and scaled marketing operations for some of the world's most successful companies.

**My credentials include:**
- **Former CMO** at 3 Fortune 500 companies
- **Marketing Director** at 5 successful startups that went public
- **Consultant** to 847 companies across 47 industries
- **Author** of 12 books on marketing optimization
- **Speaker** at 200+ marketing conferences worldwide
- **Investor** in 15 successful marketing technology companies

**But here's what's really important:** I've spent over $5.7 million of my own money testing every AI tool, every marketing strategy, every optimization technique. I've failed more times than I can count. But through those failures, I discovered something incredible.

**I discovered the secret that everyone else is using.**

**Today, I'm not just teaching this - I'm living it.** My marketing operations run themselves 24/7, generating revenue while I sleep, while I'm on vacation, while I'm spending time with my family.

**And here's what's really interesting:** 847 Fortune 500 companies have chosen to work with me. They've chosen to trust me with their most important asset - their marketing. They've chosen to follow my popular success system and transform their operations.

**And now, for the first time ever, I'm sharing this exact system with a select group of companies who are serious about using what everyone else is using.**

**But here's the catch:** I can only work with 25 companies at this level of intensity. Any more than that, and the quality suffers.

**And here's what 847 Fortune 500 companies are saying:** 'Don't wait. Don't hesitate. Don't make the same mistake we made. Join us now and start using what everyone else is using today.'"

### Objection Handling (Consensus + Social Proof: Popularity + Validation + Acceptance)

**"I need to think about it"**
"I completely understand. In fact, I respect that you want to think it through. But let me ask you something: What exactly are you thinking about? Are you thinking about whether this will work? Because I can show you 847 Fortune 500 companies who prove it does. Are you thinking about the investment? Because I can show you the exact ROI calculations.

**Or are you thinking about whether you want to use what everyone else is using?** Because that's the real question, isn't it? How much longer are you going to use strategies that nobody else is using?

**But here's the thing:** While you're thinking, those 7 spots are filling up. And once they're gone, you'll have to wait 3 months for the next opportunity.

**And here's what 847 Fortune 500 companies are saying:** 'Don't wait. Don't hesitate. Don't make the same mistake we made. Join us now and start using what everyone else is using today.'"

**"We already have marketing tools"**
"Great! So do the 847 Fortune 500 companies I've worked with. The difference is they discovered that their tools were just expensive spreadsheets that nobody else is using. Our AI platform is a popular success superpower. The question is: Do you want to keep using tools that nobody else is using, or do you want to start using a superpower that everyone else is using?

**But here's the thing:** While you're saying you already have tools, those 7 spots are filling up. And once they're gone, you'll have to wait 3 months for the next opportunity.

**And here's what 847 Fortune 500 companies are saying:** 'Don't wait. Don't hesitate. Don't make the same mistake we made. Join us now and start using what everyone else is using today.'"

**"What's the investment?"**
"The investment is $497 per month. But let me ask you this: What's the cost of NOT using what everyone else is using? What's the cost of continuing to use strategies that nobody else is using? What's the cost of not following the crowd?

**The real question isn't whether you can afford this - it's whether you can afford NOT to use what everyone else is using.**

**But here's the thing:** While you're asking about price, those 7 spots are filling up. And once they're gone, you'll have to wait 3 months for the next opportunity.

**And here's what 847 Fortune 500 companies are saying:** 'Don't wait. Don't hesitate. Don't make the same mistake we made. Join us now and start using what everyone else is using today.'"

**"I need to discuss this with my team"**
"Absolutely. In fact, I encourage that. But let me ask you something: What exactly do you need to discuss? Do you need to discuss whether you want to use what everyone else is using? Do you need to discuss whether you want to follow the crowd?

**The question isn't whether your team will support this - the question is whether you're ready to lead them to popular success.**

**But here's the thing:** While you're discussing, those 7 spots are filling up. And once they're gone, you'll have to wait 3 months for the next opportunity.

**And here's what 847 Fortune 500 companies are saying:** 'Don't wait. Don't hesitate. Don't make the same mistake we made. Join us now and start using what everyone else is using today.'"

### Close (Consensus + Social Proof: Popularity + Validation + Acceptance)
"I'm going to be completely honest with you. I don't need your money. I don't need more clients. I'm doing this because I remember what it felt like to be where you are now.

**But here's what I do need:** I need to know that you're serious about using what everyone else is using. I need to know that you're ready to stop struggling and start dominating. I need to know that you're ready to join the 847 Fortune 500 companies who have already started using what everyone else is using.

**So here's what I'm going to do:** I'm going to give you the opportunity to join this exclusive group. But I'm only going to do it if you're ready to commit to your own popular success.

**The question is:** Are you ready to stop struggling and start dominating? Are you ready to join the 847 Fortune 500 companies who dominate their markets?

**If the answer is yes, then I want you to say yes right now. Because those 7 spots are filling up fast, and your competitors aren't waiting.**

**And here's what 847 Fortune 500 companies are saying:** 'Don't wait. Don't hesitate. Don't make the same mistake we made. Join us now and start using what everyone else is using today.'"

### Follow-up (If They Hesitate - Consensus + Social Proof: Popularity + Validation + Acceptance)
"Look, I get it. Change is scary. But you know what's scarier? Continuing to struggle for the rest of your life.

**I'm going to do something I've never done before.** I'm going to send you a free 30-minute marketing audit that shows exactly how much you're struggling and what you can do about it. This audit usually costs $2,000, but I'm giving it to you free.

**But here's the catch:** You have 24 hours to review it and decide. After that, the offer expires and you go back to struggling.

**And here's the thing:** While you're deciding, those 7 spots are filling up. And once they're gone, you'll have to wait 3 months for the next opportunity.

**And here's what 847 Fortune 500 companies are saying:** 'Don't wait. Don't hesitate. Don't make the same mistake we made. Join us now and start using what everyone else is using today.'"
