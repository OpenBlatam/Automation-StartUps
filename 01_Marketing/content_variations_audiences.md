Hi [FIRST_NAME],

We screwed up.

You joined us because we promised to deliver the most advanced AI tools for your startup. But somewhere along the way, we stopped innovating.

Maybe our AI bulk document generator became outdated. Maybe we stopped sharing the breakthrough automation strategies that actually scale. Maybe we got comfortable and forgot why you chose us over the competition.

The truth is, we've been working on something revolutionary - an AI system that generates comprehensive business documents from a single query, with 99.9% accuracy and 10x faster than manual processes.

**Here's what I need from you:**

Tell me what went wrong. What AI capabilities do you need to scale your startup? What's the one feature that would make our platform indispensable?

Just hit reply and let me know. Your feedback will shape our next product roadmap.

Because your startup deserves better than what we've been giving you.

Best,
[YOUR_NAME]

P.S. We're about to launch AI features that will give you a 10x competitive advantage. But first, I want to make sure we're building them for YOU.

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

We screwed up.

You signed up for our AI marketing tools because you needed to deliver better results for your clients. But somewhere along the way, we stopped helping you win.

Maybe our AI bulk document generator became too generic for your agency's needs. Maybe we stopped sharing the client-winning strategies that actually move the needle. Maybe we got caught up in our own success and forgot why you joined us in the first place.

The truth is, we've been working on something revolutionary - an AI system that creates client-ready marketing documents in 3 minutes, with agency-specific templates and client presentation formats.

**Here's what I need from you:**

Tell me what went wrong. What do your clients need that we're not delivering? What's the one tool that would make you indispensable to your clients?

Just hit reply and let me know. Your feedback will shape everything we build.

Because your clients deserve better than what we've been giving you.

Best,

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

We screwed up.

You joined our AI course and community because you wanted to become a recognized expert in AI consulting. But somewhere along the way, we stopped providing the deep insights you needed.

**Here's what I need from you:**

Tell me what went wrong. What expertise do you need to stand out in your consulting practice? What's the one resource that would make you the go-to AI consultant in your field?

Just hit reply and let me know. Your feedback will shape our entire curriculum.
