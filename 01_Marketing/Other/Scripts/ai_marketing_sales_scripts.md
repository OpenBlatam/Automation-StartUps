# 🎯 AI Marketing Mastery Course - Sales Scripts & Conversation Guides

## 📞 Phone Call Scripts

### **Initial Strategy Call Script (15 minutes)**

#### **Opening (2 minutes)**
*"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from [Company]. Thanks for taking the time to speak with me today. I know you're busy, so I'll keep this brief and focused on how we can help you achieve your marketing goals with AI."*

**Transition:** *"Before we dive in, I'd love to understand your current situation better. Can you tell me a bit about your business and what marketing challenges you're facing right now?"*

#### **Discovery Questions (5 minutes)**
1. **Current Situation:**
   - *"What's your current monthly revenue from marketing activities?"*
   - *"How many hours per week do you spend on content creation?"*
   - *"What's your biggest marketing challenge right now?"*

2. **Goals and Aspirations:**
   - *"Where would you like to be revenue-wise in 6 months?"*
   - *"If you could wave a magic wand and fix one marketing problem, what would it be?"*
   - *"What would success look like for you in the next year?"*

3. **AI Experience:**
   - *"Have you tried any AI marketing tools before?"*
   - *"What's your biggest concern about using AI in marketing?"*
   - *"What would make you feel confident about implementing AI marketing?"*

#### **Value Presentation (5 minutes)**
*"Based on what you've told me, I think our AI Marketing Mastery Course could be exactly what you need. Let me share a quick story..."*

**Case Study:** *"Sarah, who runs a fitness apparel store, was in a similar situation to yours. She was spending 20 hours per week on content creation and only making $15K per month. After our 12-week program, she cut her content time to 3 hours per week and increased her revenue to $47K per month. That's a 213% increase."*

**Key Benefits:**
- *"You'll save 20+ hours per week on marketing tasks"*
- *"You'll increase your revenue by an average of 300% within 6 months"*
- *"You'll have access to $15,000 worth of AI marketing tools"*
- *"You'll get 1-on-1 coaching and 24/7 community support"*

#### **Objection Handling (2 minutes)**
**"I don't have time":**
*"I completely understand. That's exactly why you need this course. It's going to give you 20+ hours back per week. The time you invest in learning AI marketing will pay you back many times over."*

**"I'm not technical":**
*"That's perfect! This course is designed for marketers, not programmers. If you can use a computer and send emails, you can master AI marketing. We start from the basics and build up."*

**"It's too expensive":**
*"I understand the investment. Let me put it in perspective: if you're currently spending 20 hours per week on marketing, and you can cut that to 3 hours, that's 17 hours back. If you value your time at $50 per hour, that's $850 per week, or $3,400 per month. The course pays for itself in the first month."*

#### **Closing (1 minute)**
*"Based on our conversation, I believe this program could transform your marketing and help you achieve your goals. The next cohort starts on [Date], and we only have 25 spots available. Would you like to secure your spot today?"*

**If Yes:** *"Excellent! Let me get you set up with the enrollment process."*
**If Maybe:** *"What questions do you have that I can answer to help you make a decision?"*

## 🎯 Objection Handling Scripts

### **"I don't have time"**

The time you invest in learning AI marketing will pay you back many times over."*
