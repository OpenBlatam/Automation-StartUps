# HubSpot Message for Head of HR - Talent Agency

**Subject:** 🎉 Congratulations on [Company Name]'s Acquisition + 5 Ways to Scale Your Growing Team

Dear [Head of HR Name],

**Congratulations on your recent acquisition of [small group of companies]!** 🚀

This is a remarkable achievement that positions [Company Name] as a major player in the talent industry. I've been following your growth story, and this acquisition is a testament to your team's vision and execution excellence.

As someone who's worked with 50+ talent agencies through similar growth phases, I know that while acquisitions bring incredible opportunities, they also present unique challenges—especially around maintaining that personal touch that made your agency successful while scaling operations across multiple entities.

**The Challenge:** How do you maintain the high-touch, relationship-driven approach that defines great talent agencies while managing a rapidly expanding team and client base?

**The Solution:** HubSpot's CRM platform, specifically designed to help talent agencies scale without losing their human touch.

Here are the **top 5 ways HubSpot transforms talent agencies** during growth phases like yours:
