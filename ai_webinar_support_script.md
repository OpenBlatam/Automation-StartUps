# Customer Support Script: AI Webinar

## Original Script vs. Improved Script

### **Original Script**
```
Hey! You signed up for our AI webinar but didn't show up. The webinar was yesterday at 2 PM. We covered AI trends, machine learning basics, and Q&A session. It lasted 90 minutes. Do you want the recording? It's $50 for the replay. Let me know if you're interested.
```

### **Improved Script**

**Warm Follow-up with Understanding:**
```
Hello [Customer Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I noticed you registered for our "AI Revolution in Business" webinar that took place yesterday, and I wanted to reach out personally.

I completely understand that schedules can change unexpectedly, and sometimes life gets in the way of our planned activities. You're not alone in this - it happens to the best of us!
```

**Value-Focused Offer:**
```
The webinar was absolutely fantastic! We covered:
🎯 Current AI trends transforming industries
🧠 Practical machine learning applications for business
💡 Real-world case studies and success stories
❓ Live Q&A with industry experts

Since you couldn't make it, I'd love to offer you access to the full recording at a special rate of $50 (regularly $99). This includes:
✓ 90-minute expert presentation
✓ All slides and resources
✓ Bonus materials and templates
✓ 30-day access to rewatch anytime
```

**Empathetic Closing with Clear Next Steps:**
```
