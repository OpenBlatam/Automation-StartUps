### Problem Identification (30 seconds - 3 minutes)

**[Scene: Office environment, people working late]**

**Narrator:** "Let me start with a question that might make you uncomfortable: What if I told you that your job could be replaced by AI in the next 5 years?"

**[Scene: News headlines about AI replacing jobs]**

**Narrator:** "I know that's scary to think about, but here's the reality: 40% of jobs will be replaced by AI in the next 5 years. $15 trillion in economic value will be created by AI. Companies are already hiring AI-savvy people over traditional candidates."

**Narrator:** "Barrier #1: 'I'm not smart enough for AI.' Your brain is telling you that AI is too complex, too technical, too advanced for someone like you."

**[Scene: Person looking intimidated]**

**Narrator:** "Barrier #2: 'I need to understand everything before I start.' Your brain is telling you that you need to be an expert before you can begin."

**[Scene: Person overthinking]**

**Narrator:** "Barrier #3: 'What if I fail? What if I look stupid?' Your brain is protecting you from the discomfort of learning something new."

**[Scene: Person nodding in recognition]**

**Narrator:** "Sound familiar? These barriers are completely normal, and they're exactly what I help people overcome."
