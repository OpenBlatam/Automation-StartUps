# Sales Copy: AI SaaS Marketing Tool - ENFOQUE BASADO EN PREGUNTAS

## Target Audience: Marketing Directors, CMOs, and Digital Marketing Agencies

### Opening Hook (Question-Based)
"[Name], this is [Your Name] from [Company]. I have a quick question for you: If you could increase your campaign ROI by 300% while reducing your ad spend by 45%, would that be something you'd be interested in learning more about? And if so, do you have 3 minutes to discover how that's actually possible?"

### Problem Identification (Question-Based Discovery)
"Before I share how that's possible, let me ask you a few questions to understand your current situation better:

**Question 1:** How many hours per week would you say you spend manually optimizing your marketing campaigns?

**Question 2:** What percentage of your marketing budget do you feel is being wasted on underperforming campaigns?

**Question 3:** How often do you find yourself working late nights or weekends just to keep up with campaign management?

**Question 4:** If you could automate 80% of your campaign optimization, what would you do with that extra time?

**Question 5:** What's the biggest challenge you're facing right now when it comes to scaling your marketing efforts?

**Now, here's what's interesting:** Based on your answers, I can already tell you exactly what's holding back your marketing performance. But first, let me ask you one more question:

**What if I told you that there's a way to solve all of these problems with a single AI-powered platform?**"

### Solution Presentation (Question-Based Discovery)
"Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to ask you a series of questions, and based on your answers, I'll show you exactly how our AI Marketing Platform can solve your specific challenges.

**Question 1:** Would you be interested in a system that automatically adjusts your bids, audiences, and creative in real-time, 24/7?

**Question 2:** How valuable would it be to have an AI that predicts which campaigns will succeed before you spend a dime?

**Question 3:** What if you could generate personalized ad copy for every audience segment in under 2 minutes?

**Question 4:** How much would it be worth to you to have a system that automatically reallocates your budget to top-performing campaigns?

**Question 5:** What if you could see exactly where your competitors are investing their marketing dollars and how to beat them?

**Now, here's the question that matters most:** What if I told you that all of these capabilities are available in a single platform that integrates with your existing marketing tools?

**The question is:** Which of these capabilities would have the biggest impact on your marketing performance right now?"

### Social Proof (Question-Based Discovery)
"Now, you might be thinking: 'This sounds too good to be true.' I understand that skepticism. That's why I want to ask you a few questions about what you'd consider proof:

**Question 1:** What would convince you that this platform actually works?

**Question 2:** How many success stories would you need to see before you'd be convinced?

**Question 3:** What specific results would you want to see from companies similar to yours?

**Based on your answers, let me share some results from our clients:**

**For companies that wanted to see ROI improvements:**
- **TechCorp Global**: Increased campaign ROI by 340% in 6 months

- **B2B Services Leader**: Increased market share from 15% to 45% in 2 years

**Now, here's the question:** Which of these results would be most valuable for your company?"

### Authority Building (Question-Based Discovery)
"Now, you might be wondering: 'Who created this platform, and how do I know it will work for my company?' That's a great question. Let me ask you a few questions to understand what would give you confidence:

**Question 1:** What credentials would you want to see from the person who created this platform?

**Question 2:** How much experience would you want them to have in marketing optimization?

**Question 3:** What kind of investment would you want to see them make in testing and development?

**Based on your answers, let me share my background:**

**For companies that wanted to see credentials:**
- Former CMO at 3 Fortune 500 companies
- Marketing Director at 5 successful startups that went public
- Author of 12 books on marketing optimization
- Speaker at 200+ marketing conferences worldwide

**For companies that wanted to see experience:**
- 15 years helping companies optimize marketing performance
- Worked with 847 companies across 47 industries
- Analyzed over 50,000 marketing campaigns
- Generated over $2.3 billion in additional revenue for clients

**For companies that wanted to see investment:**
- Spent $5.7 million of my own money testing every AI tool and strategy
- Failed more times than I can count, but learned from every failure
- Built and scaled marketing operations for world's most successful companies
- Personal success with my own marketing operations running 24/7

**Now, here's the question:** Does this background give you confidence that I know what I'm talking about?"

### Scarcity + Urgency (Question-Based Discovery)
"Here's where things get interesting. Let me ask you a few questions about timing:

**Question 1:** How important is it to you to get started with marketing optimization right away?

**Question 2:** What would happen if you waited 3 months to implement a solution like this?

**Question 3:** How much revenue do you think you might be losing every month by not having this optimization?

**Based on your answers, here's the situation:**

**For companies that want to get started immediately:**
- We're only accepting 25 new clients this quarter
- We currently have 7 spots remaining
- Enrollment closes in 48 hours
- After that, you wait 3 months for the next opportunity

**For companies that are concerned about waiting:**
- Our waiting list already has 200 companies on it
- Most companies see positive ROI within 30 days
- Every month you wait is another month of lost revenue
- Your competitors aren't waiting

**For companies that want to understand the cost of delay:**
- Average client generates $50K+ in additional monthly revenue
- Every month of delay costs approximately $50K in lost revenue
- 3-month delay = $150K in lost revenue opportunity
- Investment pays for itself in first month

**Now, here's the question:** Given this information, how important is it to you to secure one of those 7 remaining spots?"

### Objection Handling (Question-Based Discovery)

**"I need to think about it"**
"That's a great question. Let me ask you a few questions to help you think through this:

**Question 1:** What specifically do you need to think about?

**Question 2:** What information would help you make this decision?

**Question 3:** How long do you typically need to make decisions like this?

**Question 4:** What would happen if you made the wrong decision?

**Question 5:** What would happen if you made the right decision?

**Based on your answers, here's what I can tell you:** Most of our clients who 'think about it' end up enrolling within 48 hours. The ones who don't usually call us back 3 months later asking if we still have spots available.

**Now, here's the question:** What would help you make this decision faster?"

**"We already have marketing tools"**
"That's a great point. Let me ask you a few questions about your current tools:

**Question 1:** How many different marketing tools are you currently using?

**Question 2:** How much time do you spend managing and integrating these tools?

**Question 3:** Are your current tools giving you the results you want?

**Question 4:** What's the biggest limitation of your current marketing stack?

**Question 5:** If you could replace 5 tools with 1 platform that does everything better, would that be valuable?

**Based on your answers, here's what I can tell you:** Most of our clients were using 3-5 different tools before switching to us. The difference is that our AI connects all your data sources and makes decisions automatically.

**Now, here's the question:** Would you be interested in seeing how our platform integrates with your existing tools?"

**"What's the investment?"**
"That's a great question. Let me ask you a few questions to understand your budget considerations:

**Question 1:** What's your current monthly marketing spend?

**Question 2:** What percentage of that spend do you feel is being wasted?

**Question 3:** How much would it be worth to you to recover that wasted spend?

**Question 4:** What's the value of your time when you're working on marketing optimization?

**Question 5:** How much additional revenue would you need to generate to justify this investment?

**Based on your answers, here's what I can tell you:** Our platform costs $497 per month, but most clients see a positive ROI within the first month. If this platform saves you just 10 hours per week and increases your conversion rate by 20%, you're looking at $5,000+ in monthly value.

**Now, here's the question:** Does this ROI make sense for your business?"

### Close (Question-Based Discovery)
"I'm going to ask you one final series of questions to help you make this decision:

**Question 1:** Based on everything we've discussed, do you believe this platform could help your marketing performance?

**Question 2:** If you could start seeing results within 30 days, would that be valuable to you?

**Question 3:** If you could get personal access to me for 30 days to ensure your success, would that give you confidence?

**Question 4:** If you could try this platform risk-free for 30 days, would that remove your concerns?

**Question 5:** If you could secure one of the 7 remaining spots right now, would you want to do that?

**Based on your answers, here's what I'm going to do:** I'm going to give you the opportunity to join this exclusive group. But I'm only going to do it if you're ready to commit to your own success.

**Now, here's the final question:** Are you ready to say yes to transforming your marketing performance, or do you need more time to think about it?"

### Follow-up (If They Hesitate - Question-Based Discovery)
"Look, I understand you need to think about this. Let me ask you a few questions to help you think through it:

**Question 1:** What's the biggest concern you have about this platform?

**Question 2:** What would need to happen for you to feel confident about this decision?

**Question 3:** If I could address your concerns, would you be ready to move forward?

**Based on your answers, here's what I'm going to do:** I'm going to send you a free 30-minute marketing audit that shows exactly how much revenue you're losing and what you can do about it. This audit usually costs $2,000, but I'm giving it to you free.

**But here's the question:** If this audit shows you're losing $50K+ per month in revenue, would that change your perspective on this investment?

**What's your email address?**"
