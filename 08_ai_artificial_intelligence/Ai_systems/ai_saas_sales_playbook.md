I'm not suggesting you change everything, but I'd love to show you how we could complement what you're already doing."

#### **Objection: "We need to think about it"**
**Response**:
"Of course, this is an important decision. To help you think through this, let me ask - what specific aspects would you like to consider further?

Is it the technical implementation, the ROI, the timeline, or something else? I'd be happy to provide additional information or connect you with a customer who had similar concerns.

What would help you feel confident about moving forward?"

#### **Objection: "We're too busy to implement something new"**
**Response**:
"I completely understand - everyone is busy these days. That's actually why many companies choose our platform - it's designed to save time, not create more work.

Our implementation process is typically 2-4 weeks, and we handle most of the heavy lifting. Plus, our AI does the work for you once it's set up.

What if I could show you how this would actually reduce your team's workload rather than increase it?"
