# Sales Copy: AI SaaS Marketing Tool - AVERSIÓN A LA PÉRDIDA

## Target Audience: Marketing Directors, CMOs, and Digital Marketing Agencies

### Opening Hook (Loss Aversion: Fear + Risk + Protection)
"[Name], this is [Your Name] from [Company]. I'm calling because I just discovered something that's going to change everything - there's a secret that 97% of marketing professionals don't know, and it's making the 3% who do know it absolutely unstoppable. But here's what's really concerning: while most companies are losing $2.3 million per year on failed marketing campaigns, the smart ones are using this system to protect their marketing budget and actually make money. In fact, let me show you exactly how much you're currently losing and how to stop losing it. Do you have 3 minutes to discover why you're losing money and how to protect it?"

### Problem Identification (Loss Aversion: Fear + Risk + Protection)
"Before I show you how to stop losing money, let me ask you something that's going to make you realize how much you're losing: How much money are you currently losing on failed marketing campaigns? How many times have you watched your marketing budget disappear with nothing to show for it? How many times have you had to explain to your CEO why you're losing money instead of making it?

**Here's what I discovered after analyzing 50,000 marketing campaigns:**

**The $2.3 Million vs. $0 Loss Divide:**
- **97% of marketing professionals** are losing $2.3 million per year on failed campaigns
- **3% of marketing professionals** are losing $0 because they're using this system

**The result?** The 97% are losing money, while the 3% are protecting their money.

**But here's what's really concerning:** The 3% aren't necessarily smarter, harder working, or more talented. They just know something that the 97% don't.

**They know the secret to protecting their marketing budget.**

**And here's what's really protective:** 847 Fortune 500 companies have already discovered this secret, and they're protecting their money while everyone else is losing it.

**The question is: How much longer are you going to lose money on failed marketing campaigns?**

**And here's what 847 Fortune 500 companies are saying:** 'We wish we had known this sooner. We wish we had stopped losing money earlier. We wish we had protected our budget sooner.'"

### Social Proof (Loss Aversion: Fear + Risk + Protection)
"Let me share something that will make you realize how much you're losing. Last month, I received this message from Sarah, who is the CMO at a Fortune 500 company:

*'[Your Name], I can't believe what's happened. In just 90 days, I went from losing $2.3 million per year to protecting my marketing budget and making $340,000 in additional revenue. I'm so glad I stopped losing money - I would have never known about this otherwise!'*

**But here's the most incredible part:** Sarah was about to lose another $2.3 million when she found our platform. She was losing money, getting no results, and ready to give up. Today, she's not just surviving - she's thriving.

**And she's not alone.** Here's what our 847 Fortune 500 clients are saying:

**The Loss Protection Millionaire Club (Clients who stopped losing money and generated $100M+ in additional revenue):**
- **TechCorp Global**: 'We went from losing $2.3 million per year to protecting our budget and making $200M in additional revenue. This isn't just a platform - it's a loss protection machine.'
- **RetailMax International**: 'We stopped losing money and now generate 5x more leads while spending 60% less. Our budget is finally protected.'
- **Enterprise Solutions Inc**: 'We went from losing money to protecting our budget, and we went from 15% market share to 45% market share in 2 years. This system doesn't just work - it protects your money.'

**The Loss Protection Efficiency Masters (Clients who stopped losing money and reduced costs by 50%+):**
- **Fortune 500 Manufacturing**: 'We went from losing $2.3 million per year to protecting our budget, and we went from $2M monthly ad spend to $800K monthly ad spend, and our revenue increased by 180%. We're finally protecting our money.'
- **Global Services Group**: 'We stopped losing money and now we're free to focus on what we do best. This system protected our budget.'
- **International Retail Chain**: 'We went from losing money to protecting our budget, and we went from working IN our marketing to working ON our marketing. Now we're the architects of our own protection.'

**The Loss Protection Market Leaders (Clients who stopped losing money and became industry leaders):**
- **Software Industry Leader**: 'We went from losing $2.3 million per year to protecting our budget, and we went from #3 in our market to #1 in 6 months. Our budget is finally protected.'
- **E-commerce Giant**: 'We stopped losing money and now we're closing deals while we sleep. This is the future of loss protection.'
- **B2B Services Leader**: 'We went from losing money to protecting our budget, and we went from 5% market share to 35% market share in 2 years. This system doesn't just work - it protects your money.'

**But here's what's really incredible:** These aren't just success stories - these are loss protection stories. These are companies that went from losing money to protecting their budget.

**And here's what 847 Fortune 500 companies are saying:** 'We wish we had known this sooner. We wish we had stopped losing money earlier. We wish we had protected our budget sooner.'"

### Authority Building (Loss Aversion: Fear + Risk + Protection)
"Now, you might be wondering: 'Who is this person, and why should I trust them?'

Let me share something personal with you. I'm [Your Name], and I've spent the last 15 years helping companies stop losing money on failed marketing campaigns. I've worked with 847 Fortune 500 companies, analyzed over 50,000 marketing campaigns, and generated over $2.3 billion in additional revenue for my clients.

**But here's what really sets me apart:** I'm not just a consultant - I'm a practitioner. I've built and scaled marketing operations for some of the world's most successful companies.

**My credentials include:**
- **Former CMO** at 3 Fortune 500 companies
- **Marketing Director** at 5 successful startups that went public
- **Consultant** to 847 companies across 47 industries
- **Author** of 12 books on marketing optimization
- **Speaker** at 200+ marketing conferences worldwide
- **Investor** in 15 successful marketing technology companies

**But here's what's really important:** I've spent over $5.7 million of my own money testing every AI tool, every marketing strategy, every optimization technique. I've failed more times than I can count. But through those failures, I discovered something incredible.

**I discovered the secret that helps you stop losing money.**

**Today, I'm not just teaching this - I'm living it.** My marketing operations run themselves 24/7, generating revenue while I sleep, while I'm on vacation, while I'm spending time with my family.

**And here's what's really interesting:** 847 Fortune 500 companies have chosen to work with me. They've chosen to trust me with their most important asset - their marketing budget. They've chosen to follow my loss protection system and transform their operations.

**And now, for the first time ever, I'm sharing this exact system with a select group of companies who are serious about stopping losing money.**

**But here's the catch:** I can only work with 25 companies at this level of intensity. Any more than that, and the quality suffers.

**And here's what 847 Fortune 500 companies are saying:** 'Don't wait. Don't hesitate. Don't make the same mistake we made. Join us now and stop losing money today.'"

### Objection Handling (Loss Aversion: Fear + Risk + Protection)

**"I need to think about it"**
"I completely understand. In fact, I respect that you want to think it through. But let me ask you something: What exactly are you thinking about? Are you thinking about whether this will work? Because I can show you 847 Fortune 500 companies who prove it does. Are you thinking about the investment? Because I can show you the exact ROI calculations.

**Or are you thinking about whether you want to stop losing money?** Because that's the real question, isn't it? How much longer are you going to lose money on failed marketing campaigns?

**But here's the thing:** While you're thinking, those 7 spots are filling up. And once they're gone, you'll have to wait 3 months for the next opportunity.

**And here's what 847 Fortune 500 companies are saying:** 'Don't wait. Don't hesitate. Don't make the same mistake we made. Join us now and stop losing money today.'"

**"We already have marketing tools"**
"Great! So do the 847 Fortune 500 companies I've worked with. The difference is they discovered that their tools were just expensive spreadsheets that make them lose money. Our AI platform is a loss protection superpower. The question is: Do you want to keep using tools that make you lose money, or do you want to start using a superpower that protects your money?

**But here's the thing:** While you're saying you already have tools, those 7 spots are filling up. And once they're gone, you'll have to wait 3 months for the next opportunity.

**And here's what 847 Fortune 500 companies are saying:** 'Don't wait. Don't hesitate. Don't make the same mistake we made. Join us now and stop losing money today.'"

**"What's the investment?"**
"The investment is $497 per month. But let me ask you this: What's the cost of NOT stopping losing money? What's the cost of continuing to lose $2.3 million per year on failed campaigns? What's the cost of not protecting your budget?

**The real question isn't whether you can afford this - it's whether you can afford NOT to stop losing money.**

**But here's the thing:** While you're asking about price, those 7 spots are filling up. And once they're gone, you'll have to wait 3 months for the next opportunity.

**And here's what 847 Fortune 500 companies are saying:** 'Don't wait. Don't hesitate. Don't make the same mistake we made. Join us now and stop losing money today.'"

**"I need to discuss this with my team"**
"Absolutely. In fact, I encourage that. But let me ask you something: What exactly do you need to discuss? Do you need to discuss whether you want to stop losing money? Do you need to discuss whether you want to protect your budget?

**The question isn't whether your team will support this - the question is whether you're ready to lead them to loss protection.**

**But here's the thing:** While you're discussing, those 7 spots are filling up. And once they're gone, you'll have to wait 3 months for the next opportunity.

**And here's what 847 Fortune 500 companies are saying:** 'Don't wait. Don't hesitate. Don't make the same mistake we made. Join us now and stop losing money today.'"

### Close (Loss Aversion: Fear + Risk + Protection)
"I'm going to be completely honest with you. I don't need your money. I don't need more clients. I'm doing this because I remember what it felt like to be where you are now.

**But here's what I do need:** I need to know that you're serious about stopping losing money. I need to know that you're ready to stop losing money on failed marketing campaigns and start protecting your budget. I need to know that you're ready to join the 847 Fortune 500 companies who have already stopped losing money.

**So here's what I'm going to do:** I'm going to give you the opportunity to join this exclusive group. But I'm only going to do it if you're ready to commit to your own loss protection.

**The question is:** Are you ready to stop losing money and start protecting your budget? Are you ready to join the 847 Fortune 500 companies who dominate their markets?

**If the answer is yes, then I want you to say yes right now. Because those 7 spots are filling up fast, and your money won't wait.**

**And here's what 847 Fortune 500 companies are saying:** 'Don't wait. Don't hesitate. Don't make the same mistake we made. Join us now and stop losing money today.'"

### Follow-up (If They Hesitate - Loss Aversion: Fear + Risk + Protection)
"Look, I get it. Change is scary. But you know what's scarier? Continuing to lose money for the rest of your life.

**I'm going to do something I've never done before.** I'm going to send you a free 30-minute marketing audit that shows exactly how much you're losing and what you can do about it. This audit usually costs $2,000, but I'm giving it to you free.

**But here's the catch:** You have 24 hours to review it and decide. After that, the offer expires and you go back to losing money.

**And here's the thing:** While you're deciding, those 7 spots are filling up. And once they're gone, you'll have to wait 3 months for the next opportunity.

**And here's what 847 Fortune 500 companies are saying:** 'Don't wait. Don't hesitate. Don't make the same mistake we made. Join us now and stop losing money today.'"
