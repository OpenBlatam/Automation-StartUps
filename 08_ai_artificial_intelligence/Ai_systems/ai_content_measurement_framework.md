## 🎨 **Content ROI Analysis**

### ROI Calculation Methods

   Content ROI = (Direct Revenue from Content - Content Cost) / Content Cost × 100
   
   Example:
   - Content Production Cost: $2,000
   - Direct Revenue Generated: $15,000
   - Content ROI: ($15,000 - $2,000) / $2,000 × 100 = 650%
   ```

   Content ROI = (Leads Generated × Average Lead Value - Content Cost) / Content Cost × 100
   
   Example:
   - Content Cost: $1,500
   - Leads Generated: 150
   - Average Lead Value: $200
   - Content ROI: (150 × $200 - $1,500) / $1,500 × 100 = 1,900%
   ```

3. **Brand Awareness Value**
   ```

   Example:
   - Content Cost: $1,000
   - Reach: 100,000
   - Engagement Rate: 5%
   - Brand Value Multiplier: $0.50
   - Brand Awareness Value: 100,000 × 0.05 × $0.50 = $2,500
