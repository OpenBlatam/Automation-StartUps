## Template Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Each Template

1. **Cost Estimation Request** - Use when you're in the initial planning phase and need to understand the cost structure of your event before finalizing the budget.

2. **Budget Allocation Strategy** - Use when you have a fixed budget amount and need guidance on how to distribute funds across different expense categories to maximize ROI.

3. **Cost Reduction Strategies** - Use when you need to optimize expenses without sacrificing event quality, particularly useful for budget-constrained events.

4. **Revenue Sources Inquiry** - Use when planning to offset event costs through various revenue streams, including sponsorships, ticket sales, or merchandise.

5. **Comprehensive Budget Template** - Use when you need a complete, structured budget framework that accounts for all expenses, income, and contingencies.

### Customization Tips

- Replace all placeholders with specific, relevant information
- Be precise with numbers and amounts to get accurate estimates

- Include context about your event's goals and constraints
- Specify any unique requirements or constraints that might affect costs
- Mention your geographic location if it impacts pricing
