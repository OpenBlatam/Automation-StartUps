   - Target market/region names (be specific: "Tokyo, Japan" vs "Japan")
   - Product/service descriptions (include key features)
   - Audience characteristics (demographics, psychographics)
   - Specific goals or challenges (quantify when possible)
5. **Add Context**: Include additional context in a preamble:
   ```
   Context: We are a B2B SaaS company with 50 employees, entering the German market for the first time. Our product is an AI-powered CRM platform targeting mid-market companies (50-500 employees) in the technology sector.
   ```

#### **Phase 3: Execution (30-60 minutes)**
6. **Run the Prompt**: Use the customized prompt with your AI tool.
7. **Review Output**: Analyze the response for:
   - Actionable recommendations
   - Cultural sensitivity
   - Regulatory compliance
   - Feasibility
8. **Ask Follow-ups**: Use insights to generate deeper questions.

#### **Phase 4: Validation (1-2 hours)**
9. **Local Validation**: Have native speakers or local experts review:
   - Cultural appropriateness
   - Language accuracy
   - Market relevance
10. **Document Results**: Create a structured report with:
    - Key insights
    - Prioritized recommendations
    - Action items with owners
    - Timeline and milestones
    - Success metrics

### **Best Practices:**

#### **Prompt Optimization:**
- ✅ **Be Specific**: "SaaS CRM for mid-market tech companies in Berlin" vs "software for Germany"
- ✅ **Add Constraints**: Include budget, timeline, team size, technical limitations
- ✅ **Request Format**: Ask for structured output (bullet points, tables, checklists)
- ✅ **Set Context**: Provide industry background, competitive landscape
- ✅ **Quantify Goals**: "Increase conversion by 30%" vs "improve performance"

#### **Cultural Sensitivity:**
- ✅ **Local Review**: Always have native speakers review content
- ✅ **Regulatory Check**: Verify compliance with local laws (GDPR, data privacy, etc.)
- ✅ **Cultural Testing**: Test with local focus groups before full launch
- ✅ **Respect Traditions**: Understand religious holidays, cultural taboos
- ✅ **Language Variants**: Consider regional dialects (Spanish in Spain vs Mexico)

#### **Quality Assurance:**
- ✅ **Multi-Source Validation**: Cross-reference AI responses with expert opinions
- ✅ **Iterative Refinement**: Use responses to generate better follow-up questions
- ✅ **Documentation**: Maintain a knowledge base of localization learnings
- ✅ **Metrics Tracking**: Define KPIs before launch and measure continuously
- ✅ **Feedback Loops**: Establish channels for local user feedback

### **Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**

❌ **Over-generalization**: "Asian market" is too broad; specify countries
❌ **Literal Translation**: Word-for-word translation misses cultural context
❌ **Assumptions**: Don't assume cultural norms; validate with locals
❌ **One-Size-Fits-All**: Different regions need different approaches
❌ **Ignoring Regulations**: GDPR, data residency, payment regulations vary
❌ **Rushing Validation**: Skipping local expert review leads to costly mistakes
