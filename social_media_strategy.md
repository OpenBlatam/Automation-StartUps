### Appendix J: ROI Calculation Examples

#### Example 1: Brand Awareness Campaign

**Investment:**
- Content creation: $500
- Paid advertising: $2,000
- Tools and software: $200
- **Total Investment: $2,700**

**Results:**
- Reach: 100,000 people
- Impressions: 250,000
- New followers: 2,000
- Website visits: 1,500

**Value Calculation:**
- Estimated value per impression: $0.01
- Estimated value per follower: $2
- Estimated value per website visit: $1

**Total Value:**
- Impressions: 250,000 × $0.01 = $2,500
- Followers: 2,000 × $2 = $4,000
- Website visits: 1,500 × $1 = $1,500
- **Total Value: $8,000**

**ROI:**
ROI = (($8,000 - $2,700) / $2,700) × 100 = **196%**

#### Example 2: Lead Generation Campaign

**Investment:**
- Content creation: $300
- Paid advertising: $1,500
- Landing page: $200
- **Total Investment: $2,000**

**Results:**
- Leads generated: 150
- Cost per lead: $2,000 / 150 = $13.33
- Conversion rate: 10% (15 sales)
- Average sale value: $100

**Revenue:**
- 15 sales × $100 = $1,500

**ROI:**
ROI = (($1,500 - $2,000) / $2,000) × 100 = **-25%** (needs optimization)

**Break-even analysis:**
- Need 20 sales to break even
- Need 2.67% conversion rate instead of 10%
- Or need to reduce cost per lead to $10

#### Example 3: Influencer Partnership

**Investment:**
- Influencer fee: $5,000
- Product cost: $500

**Additional Value:**
- Brand awareness value: $2,000
- Content rights value: $1,000
- **Total Value: $7,000**

**ROI:**
ROI = (($7,000 - $6,000) / $6,000) × 100 = **17%**
