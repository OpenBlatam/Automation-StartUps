Earned Media Value (EMV):
EMV = Σ(Media Mentions × Publication Reach × Engagement Rate × Conversion Rate × Average Deal Value)

Brand Value (BV):
BV = (Brand Awareness Improvement × Target Audience Size × Brand Value Multiplier) + 
     (Brand Perception Improvement × Customer Lifetime Value × Perception Impact Factor)

Lead Value (LV):
LV = (Qualified Leads Generated × Lead Conversion Rate × Average Deal Value) + 
     (Lead Quality Improvement × Conversion Rate Improvement × Revenue Impact)

Partnership Value (PV):
PV = (Strategic Partnerships × Partnership Value × Duration Factor) + 
     (Referral Value × Referral Rate × Average Referral Value)

Competitive Advantage Value (CAV):
CAV = (Market Share Improvement × Market Size × Share Value) + 
      (Competitive Positioning × Positioning Value × Sustainability Factor)

Long-term Strategic Value (LTSV):
LTSV = (Industry Recognition × Recognition Value × Duration Factor) +
