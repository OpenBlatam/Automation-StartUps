Subject: Outgrow HubSpot? Here's Your Upgrade Path

Hi [First Name],

I noticed you've been using HubSpot for [X months/years]. 

Most growing businesses hit HubSpot's limitations around the 12-18 month mark:
• Basic automation that can't handle complex workflows
• Limited AI capabilities for content generation
• No bulk operations for scaling content
• SMB-focused features that don't scale to enterprise

The good news? You don't have to choose between staying with HubSpot's limitations or paying enterprise prices.

We help 500+ companies upgrade from HubSpot with:
✅ 40% more AI capabilities than HubSpot
✅ Enterprise features at SMB prices
✅ Bulk document generation (thousands from one query)
✅ 30-day implementation vs. HubSpot's complexity

Want to see how [Similar Company] upgraded from HubSpot and increased their lead generation by 200%?

Hi [First Name],

Yesterday I mentioned how we help companies upgrade from HubSpot.

**The Problem:**
"We were spending 20+ hours per week on manual tasks that HubSpot couldn't automate. Our team was frustrated with the limitations, but we couldn't afford enterprise solutions." - Sarah, Marketing Director

We implemented our platform in 30 days and immediately saw:
• 95% reduction in manual document generation
• 200% increase in lead generation
• 60% reduction in marketing operations time
• 40% lower cost than HubSpot enterprise

**The Result:**
