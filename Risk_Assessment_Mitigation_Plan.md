## Risk Assessment Matrix

### Risk Scoring Methodology

#### Probability Assessment
- **Very High (5):** >80% probability
- **High (4):** 60-80% probability
- **Medium (3):** 40-60% probability
- **Low (2):** 20-40% probability
- **Very Low (1):** <20% probability

#### Impact Assessment
- **Critical (5):** >$1,000,000 impact
- **High (4):** $500,000 - $1,000,000 impact
- **Medium (3):** $100,000 - $500,000 impact
- **Low (2):** $25,000 - $100,000 impact
- **Very Low (1):** <$25,000 impact

#### Risk Score Calculation
**Risk Score = Probability × Impact**

### Risk Rating Levels
- **Critical (20-25):** Immediate action required
- **High (15-19):** Action required within 30 days
- **Medium (10-14):** Action required within 90 days
