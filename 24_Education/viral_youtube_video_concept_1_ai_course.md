### **STORY SETUP (15-45 seconds)**
**[Visual: Personal story montage]**

### **CURIOSITY LOOP 2 (45-75 seconds)**

"I now have 12 clients paying me $800-2,000 per month for AI services. And the best part? I'm working less than ever before."

### **CURIOSITY LOOP 3 (300-420 seconds)**
**[Visual: Course community, live sessions]**

"But here's what really makes this course special - it's not just the content. It's the community. You get access to live Q&A sessions, a private Discord with 2,000+ students, and direct access to the instructors."

**[Visual: Community screenshots, live session recordings]**

"And the support doesn't end when you finish the course. They're constantly updating it with new AI tools and strategies. I've been a student for 6 months, and I'm still learning new things every week."
