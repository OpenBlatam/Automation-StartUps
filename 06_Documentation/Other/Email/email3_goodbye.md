Hi [FIRST_NAME],

This is it. Your final email from us.

We're cleaning up our list to respect your inbox, and you're on the removal list.

But before we say goodbye, let me give you one last reason to stay:

**The AI Marketing Revolution is happening NOW.**

While you've been away, we've built something that changes everything:
- AI bulk document generation that saves 10+ hours per project
- Marketing automation that actually converts
- Course content that turns beginners into AI experts

Our next cohort starts in 2 weeks. The AI tools we're teaching are the same ones Fortune 500 companies are paying $50,000+ to access.

**Here's your choice:**

Stay on the list and get exclusive access to our AI breakthrough content, or we'll respectfully remove you right now.

No hard feelings either way. But if you stay, you'll be part of something special.

**Stay for the AI revolution:** [LINK TO STAY]

**Or unsubscribe:** [LINK TO UNSUBSCRIBE]

The decision is yours.

Best,
[YOUR_NAME]

P.S. This is the last email you'll receive from us. Make it count.
