## 🎯 **ROI SUPREMO OPTIMIZATION**

### **ROI Calculation Framework**

**Fórmulas Supremas**:
```
Basic ROI:
ROI = (Revenue - Investment) / Investment × 100

Advanced ROI:
ROI = (LTV × Customers - CAC × Customers - Investment) / Investment × 100

Where:
- LTV = Customer Lifetime Value
- CAC = Customer Acquisition Cost
- Customers = Number of customers acquired

Example Calculation:
- Investment: $10,000/month
- CAC: $500/customer
- LTV: $25,000/customer
- Customers: 20/month
- Revenue: 20 × $25,000 = $500,000
- Cost: 20 × $500 + $10,000 = $20,000
- ROI: ($500,000 - $20,000) / $20,000 × 100 = 2,400%
```

**ROI Optimization Strategies**:
```
Cost Reduction:
- Automation: -80% manual costs
